Two amendments. Comments on the pull requests are encouraged, so that meaningful discussion is archived in a useful way that can be referred to later without much fuss. Of course, suggested changes are also invited.</p>
<p>

1) https://github.com/CSUA/CSUA-Constitution/pull/2/files
The first is to clean up the constitution. It makes officer position descriptions more concise and accurate, and makes explicit the power of officers to exercise discretion in delegating duties. There is no substantial change in roles or duties. This amendment also addresses a slight error in election procedure, and alters politburo meeting votes to reflect the current (and long-standing) practice
</p>

Again, the intention for this amendment is to simplify and clarify; the duties have been made more concise but are otherwise not altered.
<p>
A constitution so amended would look like this: https://github.com/CSUA/CSUA-Constitution/blob/a5edcc5169aadb4ed49cb4501340abb22c5f4ce3/Constitution.markdown
</p>
<p>
2) https://github.com/CSUA/CSUA-Constitution/pull/3/files
The second is the amendment that merges Events roles and distributes Outreach duties to President and Events. This amendment is applied on top of the cleanup amendment very straightforwardly.
</p> <p>
A constitution so amended would look like this: https://github.com/CSUA/CSUA-Constitution/blob/db0e857d64dadcdb835500b7d1c60238c17db88f/Constitution.markdown
