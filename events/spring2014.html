                            Have you ever wanted to learn front-end web design to build your own
                            website? Or do you know basic HTML & CSS but want to learn how to use
                            the jQuery JavaScript library to add cool features to your site?
                            This workshop is for you! This fast-paced overview of front-end web
                            development will be covering HTML, CSS, and jQuery. Stay for everything or

                            A cloud atlas is a pictorial key (or atlas) to the nomenclature of clouds
                            and was used in the recent past to understand the vagaries of the weather.
                            A good knowledge of the cloud atlas often made the difference between life
                            and death especially at sea.

                            Architect at Prismatic, a ground-breaking new discovery app rapidly
                            growing into its second year of expansion. Jenny completed her
                            undergrad degree in Computer Science at Columbia, followed that
                            with her MS and PhD in Computer Science at Stanford, and finally
                            completed a post-doctoral fellowship at MIT and Columbia. During
                            the course of her academic career she published seventeen different
                            papers on machine learning and natural language processing, and
                            created the widely-used Stanford Named Entity Recognition software
                            package.
