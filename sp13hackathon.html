					<h3>
						Rules
					</h3>

				</p>
				Registration for the Hackathon is day-of. 
</p>

<b>Submission Requirements:</b></p>


Register your team day-of. Write a good description of your project (1-2 sentences). Set up a github repo (private) for your team day-of. You will use this repo to submit your project.
</p>

Github has excellent tutorials on how to use git and how to setup a repository on github. This type of technology can be life-saving for group projects. For those who know svn, you can use svn with github via git+svn. http://help.github.com/
</p>

<b>Judging Criteria:
</b></p>

Completion will be a factor in judging but submissions will not be disqualified for lack of completion.
</p>

Bugs are okay! You're building a quick hack, not production-quality software!
</p>

If you make any special claims about the capabilities of your software, please present proof of your claims in your presentation.
</p>

The presentation itself doesn't need to be super-high quality - we understand you'll probably be sleep-deprived and not all there. But don't forget to substantiate claims!
</p>

The description is not graded, but it will be used to help the judges refer to teams' projects while judging.

</p>

<b>Exceptions to the Rules: </b>
</p>

Yes, you can code alone or in pairs or in a group of 5 if you want, but we're only handing out 1 prize to a lone star, 2 prizes to a team of 2, proceeding up to 4 prizes for a team of 4+ people. You'll have to distribute the prizes amongst your group.
</p>

To be eligible for prizes, your team must consist entirely of CAL undergraduates, with teams of 4 or lower receiving preference. The point of this hackathon is to write that hack you've always wanted to do, or really want to do right now! Prizes, while super awesome, are merely an incentive to get you to stay up all night long, as is the 24 hours of food.
</p>

There are 3 large prize groups! 1st place winners get first pick at the prize groups, then 2nd place group, then 3rd place. That means 1st place winner may choose the 2nd place price if they desire. </p>

</p>
<b>Pre-Hackathon Okays and NotOkays:</b>
</p>

All code written must be written in the 18-hour period, or explicitly flagged as written beforehand.
Making significant use of pre-written non-framework/non-library code is strongly discouraged.</p>

Libraries are totally fine.
Anything reasonably called a "framework" should be fine.</p>

Improvements to a library may not be considered in the main body of a work if they are merely incidental to the project, rather than a major component.
Non-coding design pre-work is acceptable.
Likewise for product development.
Fleshing out and preparation work, in general, should be no big deal.
If a project does not pass a "smell test", judges may, at their discretion, take this factor into consideration when evaluating the project.</p>

It is recommended that a README file be included which explains the necessary disclaimers for pre-work, libraries, etc., and summarizes the work done. However, this is neither required nor scored.</p>
